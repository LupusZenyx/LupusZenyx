# Hi there! üåü I'm

I'm a developer based in Germany, and I love to explore the world of technology. Don't expect me to commit very often, as I am waaay too busy sorting all those forks in my /dish-washer. Here's a little about me:

## About Me

üöÄ I'm deeply interested in Digital Art, Front End development, things like Algorithmic bias, UI-Design, Data Mining & Analysis plus Cloud Computing.

‚úâÔ∏è You can, of course, contact me through any way you find but I'm very good at not checking my inbox. Just bomb my Discord @ [Daxastroph](https://discordapp.com/users/858408960607518739)


## Programming Languages

Yeah, I know my poison:
- **Python:** I use Python for tasks ranging from web development with Django to data analysis with libraries like Pandas. I do the wub wub with the numbers

- **Ruby:** Ruby is my go-to for scripting and web development with Ruby on Rails. Odin might help you if you're interested.

- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript:** I leverage this trio to create interactive web applications. Yes, its mostly websites that do funky stuff.

- **Swift:** I use Swift for developing powerful and intuitive iOS and macOS applications. Might as well create an app to write this markdown for me.

- **Kotlin:** I'm currently exploring Kotlin and beginning to learn its ins and outs. Tbh I just saw it and thought it was cool.

- **Java:** I only use Java when forced to by school. Mr. Big knows the way of the java-chopper.

## Tools of the Trade

I work with the following tools and equipment:

- **Machines and Devices: **
  - MacBook Pro 2017 13"
  - Windows 11 Machine (way too lazy to write all the specs, like who cares anyways?)
  - Graphic Tablet (no i don't code with this, wtf)

- **Development Environments:**
  - Visual Studio (when forced to)
  - IntelliJ
  - Sublime Text
  - Atom


## Other Interests

When I'm not coding, I have a passion for creativity:

- üì∫ Watching interesting content on YouTube.
- üé® I enjoy bringing my imagination to life through drawing, both on paper and on my trusty drawing tablet. (No, I won't draw Mr.Big in an excavator)
